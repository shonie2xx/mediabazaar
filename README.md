<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was build in group of 4 students. It is windows form application developed in C#.


### Project assignment
Our main goal was to help media bazaar solve the following problems:
-	Managers don’t have a registry of fired people, a way to know why an employee has been fired or what is the reason for quitting.
-	Managers can’t keep track of their employees. They don’t know who is really working for the company, when the employees are working.
-	Managers can’t assign work shifts properly. They need something like calendar containing scheduled working hours. They do not want to be google calendar.
-	Managers don’t have a clean view over attendance and work hours of their employees
-	Managers don’t have a way to easily promote/demote a person
-	Managers need a way to easily renew an employee’s working contract
-	Employees don’t know when their work shifts start
-	Shelves in store don’t get restocked because there is no system that tracks how much of the stock is left in the storage
-	The company needs a database to store the credentials of its employees and information about their work (First name, last name, gender, birth date, birthplace, nationality, languages, BSN number, home address, FTI, work start date, work position, last day of work, how much work was actually done)
